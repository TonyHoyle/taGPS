GPS Relay for Tesla Android

Early version, expect bugs.

1. Disable browser GPS on TA
2. Connecct phone to TA hotspot
3. Launch app

To have the app remain active in the background select the background option.  It will try to connect as you go in and out
of range of the car, but not a good idea to leave it in that state as it's still using battery to do that.  
Still working on ways to get the power usage down.
